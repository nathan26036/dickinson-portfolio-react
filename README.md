# Dickinson Portfolio

The goal of this project is to make a portfolio for myself. It should have four different sections that can be navigated through the navbar. The main section should be an about me page that includes a picture of me and some text about me. The next section is the portfolio section that should have six projects I have done and their links. The next tab will be the contacts page that will check if someone inputs something and if not they will get a message saying it is required. The last section is the resume which will include a downloadable resume and some cards about what i can do.

## The process

### What i did
* Created the vite config to get it started
* Created main jsx to add router paths for the navbar to open the correct pages
* Created the app jsx to display all the pages contents with a header and a footer
* Created navtabs that tells what goes in the navbar and what each tab will link too
* Created footer that has three different links of apps I have
* Created five different pages for each section that has all the content for that section plus an error page
* Created a helper for the contacts page to verify if the email is in correct email format and if not an error message will appear
* Created html file which takes in all of these pages and actually gets them in html format
